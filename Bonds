No one else should have to endure the hardships I’ve been through.
My parents are supportive and loving, but I don’t want them to worry about me. To protect them, I am often vague about my adventuring life.
I was raised in a huge, family circus and always surrounded by sisters, cousins, uncles, and friends. They taught me the value of hard work, self-reliance, and teamwork… but privacy was hard to come by.
The most important person in the world to me died when I was too young and inexperienced to stop it. I won’t let that happen again.
Finding my teacher saved my life. Before meeting them I was on a dark path that likely would have led to my untimely demise.
Finding my student changed my life. My order/beliefs had become hollow, but I gained deeper understanding and passion for living when I had someone to guide in their own journey.
I’m in love with my best friend, and have been for years. But I don’t know how to tell him/her yet.
I took refuge in a marsh or swamp for a time. I know its foliage, fauna, and murky waters better than any city’s streets.
I’ve spent much of my life on the water, and the sea is my home. I don’t enjoy being on solid ground for long periods.
I’m a city kid, born and bred. There’s nowhere like my streets. It’s a cruel and hard place… but I’m the only one who’s allowed to insult it!
My old temple is where my heart is. The stone walls and belfries are my retreat, the place of calm & repose that I return to when the chaos of the outside world becomes too much.
I once met a deity in disguise on the material plane. It changed my life completely, for good or ill.
I gave up soldiering after a contentious war or exceptionally bloody battle. No one should ever have to see what I’ve seen, or do what I’ve done.
I grew up with a loving family, plenty to eat, and good social opportunities… but painfully bored. Meeting a group of monster hunters inspired me to take up the adventuring life!
I’ve already lived once. Now I have a second chance to do things differently.
The love of my life went missing under mysterious circumstances, but my friends & family don’t (won’t?) believe my suspicions.
I painstakingly hand-bound my own spellbook and fill it will all my magical research.
This sacred weapon once wielded by my deity has been passed down through my temple. And now that it has come to me, it is my duty to use it wisely.
I am tracking a fell beast across the land to destroy it. And I’m so intent on my goal that the line between hunter and hunted sometimes blurs.
I have a good luck talisman. With my lucky charm in my pocket, everything is sunshine and rainbows!
I was raised on a farm and have an affinity for/skill with a particular type of animal. Ex: horses, goats, geese.
I always wear a piece of jewelry. It was given to me by a relative who has since passed away. I treasure it, but do not understand the runes/symbols inscribed upon it.
Food. I’m an insatiable epicurean – I’ve tried every food imaginable. And if I come across one I haven’t, let no beholder stand in my way of a new culinary experience!
I was raised by wolves. As a result, I like dogs more than people and often ignore humanoids if a canid is available – I’d rather conduct business with the inn’s St. Bernard instead of the barkeep.
I have a collection that is my pride and joy… maybe verging into obsession. I’m an expert on the subject. Ex: pins, exotic cheeses, snails, monster scat.

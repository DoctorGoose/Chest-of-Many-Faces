# NPCgenerator

WIP Npc generator for use in TTRPGs or whatever else you would like

likely to migrate to usage of a class to create npcs, as of right now the script isn't utilizing functions or classes, this is due to this originally being much simpler in origin, but quickly evolving to a generator of sorts

at time of writing name lists contain over 800 names, and personality lists contain between 100 and 300 options

Biases will be created to generate more humans, elves, dwarves and tieflings than the other races. Ideally looking to be able to set custom biases.

working on the idea of having a simple gui

TBA:
